		# Mandetory:
		# - Use of default MGS big gears and motor gears 	
		# - Easier printing, easier assembly
		# - Quick release idler

		# - Mount for both i3 standards, 24mm and 30mm holes

		# Really nice to have:
		# - Easy exchange of filament feed guides
		# - Easy replacement of filament drive wheel
		# - easy assembly
		# - nice looking
		# - Extrusion cooling fan
		# - Adapter for i2s and ordbots
